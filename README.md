Classpip is a software architecture for teachers and students to perform school gamification activities inside the school environment through different platforms such as mobiles, tablets and computers.

The software architecture is composed by two mobile applications for performing “quick” class activities oriented to teachers and students. For “long” operations such as deep into reports and setup the platform there is an administration dashboard accessible from every computer. These three pieces share the information through a service-oriented architecture that exposes the main methods for data manipulation.
